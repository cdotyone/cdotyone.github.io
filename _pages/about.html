<h1>Good day fellow readers and welcome to my tech blog !</h1>

<p>
My name Chris Doty.
I am currently working as a Senior Solution Engineer specialized in Application Development.
My main task is to code the IaC, code CICD the pipelines, and teach Agile practices for customer's of Breakfree Soltions.

<p>
The purpose of my life?
I have been coding most of my life.  Don't remember much before it.  I have successfully reprogrammed my brain to need coding to keep my sanity.
